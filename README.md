# :grey_question: What is LiftKit?

LiftKit is a UI framework that makes you a better designer without even realizing it. At its core, it's a platform-agnostic system of formulas for scaling, spacing, and color that automatically enforce high-detail design principles behind the scenes. You get easy utility classes, and LiftKit applies golden ratio scaling, optical symmetry, and contrast ratio checks for you under the hood.

## Overview

- The following instructions are easier to read on our website: See [Documentation](https://www.chainlift.io/liftkit/get-started)

### This is the official repo.

This is the official repository. Currently, it only has support for Next.js without Tailwind. The project is mmaintained by Chainlift, which is itself maintained entirely by part-time contributors. So while we do plan to expand support to every framework imaginable, we are currently limited by time and availability.

Community contributors are responsible for their own forks. However, we help out however we can by adding serious contributors to our internal Slack, where they can communicate and collaborate with everyone else working on the project.

### Community Projects

Not officially supported by Chainlift, but we do communicate with the owners. Contact each project's owner for support.

- [liftkit-tailwind](https://github.com/jellydeck/liftkit-tailwind)

### How to Become a Contributor

We strongly prefer that contributors work with us directly to maintain the system's integrity.

If interested in contributing and being listed on our site and this readme, contact info@chainlift.io with a brief introduction and description of how you'd like to help.

# Install for Next.js

This documentation assumes the following:

- You already have **Node.js**, **npm**, and **Git** installed on your local machine
- You’re familiar with basic terminal commands like `cd`

## 1. Create the Config Files

### Option A: Clone Template Project

1. Paste the following command into your terminal to clone the template:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chainlift/liftkit-template.git
   ```

2. `cd` into the newly-created project.

   - If you get an error that says `direnv: error`, just ignore it. It's a bug we'll fix soon.

3. Run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Install the components you need (see section 2 below).
5. Import LiftKit’s CSS into your app’s `globals.css`:

   ```css
   @import url("@/lib/css/index.css");
   ```

#### What’s in the template?

A blank Next.js project with LiftKit Core’s config files pre-installed—fastest way to get up and running.

---

### Option B: Add to Existing Next.js Project

1. `cd` into your project’s root directory.
2. Install LiftKit CLI as a dev dependency:

   ```bash
   npm install @chainlift/liftkit --save-dev
   ```

3. Initialize LiftKit:

   ```bash
   npx liftkit init
   ```

   - If prompted to add an `add` script to `package.json`, say **yes**.
   - If prompted to install **shadcn** as a devDependency, say **yes**.

4. Install the components you need (see section 2 below).
5. Import LiftKit’s CSS into your app’s `globals.css`:

   ```css
   @import url("@/lib/css/index.css");
   ```

#### What does `npx liftkit init` do?

It adds two files to your project root:

- `components.json`
- `tailwind.config.ts`

> _You do not need Tailwind itself to use LiftKit—just the config file for now._

---

## 2. Install LiftKit Components & Styles

LiftKit Core is just the base config. LiftKit Components are the actual UI components (with their CSS). At build time, unused CSS is tree-shaken away.

| Method            | Instructions                                      | Command                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Everything**    | All components, CSS, and types                    | `npm run add all`                       |
| **One Component** | Specified component only (with its CSS and types) | `npm run add component-name-kebab-case` |
| **Base**          | CSS and types only                                | `npm run add base`                      |

> If warned about React 19 compatibility, add `--force` and proceed.

## FAQ

- **I only installed one component, but it installed multiple. Why?**
  Some components import others. E.g., installing `Badge` also brings in `Icon`.
- **Why did it install CSS for components I’m not using?**
  By design—to let you play freely. Unused styles are removed at build time.
- **How can I get rid of unused CSS?**
  It’s automatically removed at build time.
- **Does LiftKit require Tailwind?**
  No—only a `tailwind.config.ts` file is needed (a requirement of the current registry). Tailwind itself is _not_ a dependency.

## The Figma Template

> **Warning:** It’s currently a dumpster fire. We’re working on improvements—contributors welcome!

### Clone the Community File

- [View File on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1404856652359938563) (opens in new tab)

---

## Known Issues

### Button variants are out of control

- We know. We’ll fix it soon.

  - Buttons adjust padding based on icon presence, and padding values aren’t controllable via props.
  - Our only option was to list everything explicitly—clearly a bad idea in hindsight.

### Local variables need documentation

- Figma doesn’t support margins or `em` units, so we converted everything to pixels (assuming `1rem = 16px`).
- Variables are organized into collections:

  - **Global collection** = base `LkSizeUnit` variables
  - **Text Spacing Vals** = subsets per `LkFontClass`, simulating spacing props like `.m-bottom-xs`
