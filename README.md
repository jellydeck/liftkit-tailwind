# :grey_question: What is LiftKit?
LiftKit is a UI framework based on the golden ratio. At its core, it's a set of formulas and variables that unlock advanced visual design features like optical spacing corrections and dynamic color, powered by Material 3. 

## Getting Started
- The following instructions are easier to read on our website: See [Documentation](https://www.chainlift.io/liftkit/get-started)

# Install

This documentation assumes the following:

* You already have **Node.js**, **npm**, and **Git** installed on your local machine
* Youâ€™re familiar with basic terminal commands like `cd`

## 1. Create the Config Files

### Option A: Clone Template Project

1. Paste the following command into your terminal to clone the template:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chainlift/liftkit-template.git
   ```
2. `cd` into the newly-created project.

   * If you get an error that says `direnv: error`, just ignore it. It's a bug we'll fix soon.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Install the components you need (see section 2 below).
5. Import LiftKitâ€™s CSS into your appâ€™s `globals.css`:

   ```css
   @import url('@/lib/css/index.css');
   ```

#### Whatâ€™s in the template?

A blank Next.js project with LiftKit Coreâ€™s config files pre-installedâ€”fastest way to get up and running.

---

### Option B: Add to Existing Next.js Project

1. `cd` into your projectâ€™s root directory.
2. Install LiftKit CLI as a dev dependency:

   ```bash
   npm install @chainlift/liftkit --save-dev
   ```
3. Initialize LiftKit:

   ```bash
   npx liftkit init
   ```

   * If prompted to add an `add` script to `package.json`, say **yes**.
   * If prompted to install **shadcn** as a devDependency, say **yes**.
4. Install the components you need (see section 2 below).
5. Import LiftKitâ€™s CSS into your appâ€™s `globals.css`:

   ```css
   @import url('@/lib/css/index.css');
   ```

#### What does `npx liftkit init` do?

It adds two files to your project root:

* `components.json`
* `tailwind.config.ts`

> *You do not need Tailwind itself to use LiftKitâ€”just the config file for now.*

---

## 2. Install LiftKit Components & Styles

LiftKit Core is just the base config. LiftKit Components are the actual UI components (with their CSS). At build time, unused CSS is tree-shaken away.

| Method            | Instructions                                      | Command                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Everything**    | All components, CSS, and types                    | `npm run add all`                       |
| **One Component** | Specified component only (with its CSS and types) | `npm run add component-name-kebab-case` |
| **Base**          | CSS and types only                                | `npm run add base`                      |

> If warned about React 19 compatibility, add `--force` and proceed.

## FAQ

* **I only installed one component, but it installed multiple. Why?**
  Some components import others. E.g., installing `Badge` also brings in `Icon`.
* **Why did it install CSS for components Iâ€™m not using?**
  By designâ€”to let you play freely. Unused styles are removed at build time.
* **How can I get rid of unused CSS?**
  Itâ€™s automatically removed at build time.
* **Does LiftKit require Tailwind?**
  Noâ€”only a `tailwind.config.ts` file is needed (a requirement of the current registry). Tailwind itself is *not* a dependency.

## The Figma Template

> **Warning:** Itâ€™s currently a dumpster fire. Weâ€™re working on improvementsâ€”contributors welcome!

### Clone the Community File

* [View File on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1404856652359938563) (opens in new tab)

---

## Known Issues

### Button variants are out of control

* We know. Weâ€™ll fix it soon.

  * Buttons adjust padding based on icon presence, and padding values arenâ€™t controllable via props.
  * Our only option was to list everything explicitlyâ€”clearly a bad idea in hindsight.

### Local variables need documentation

* Figma doesnâ€™t support margins or `em` units, so we converted everything to pixels (assuming `1rem = 16px`).
* Variables are organized into collections:

  * **Global collection** = base `LkSizeUnit` variables
  * **Text Spacing Vals** = subsets per `LkFontClass`, simulating spacing props like `.m-bottom-xs`
